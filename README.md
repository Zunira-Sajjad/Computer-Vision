# Computer-Vision
Some of my Computer Vision assignments and project. If you want to implement them from scratch then these files will be very helpful for you. Happy Learning! 

Computer Vision is an integral part of Machine Learning as it enables algorithms to process and interpret visual data from the world around us. It has numerous
practical applications, including image recognition, object detection, and even self-driving cars, making it an essential component of many cutting-edge ML projects.
